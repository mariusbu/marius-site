    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="two-columns">
      <p>I’m a software engineer with 18 years of professional experience. Having worked for Trolltech, Nokia and later co-founded a company, I have been able to work in both very large and very small organisations, contributing to products that were being used by millions of people.</p>
      <p>One of the most important things this has taught me is to be aware of how software engineering and product development fits within the larger scope of the organisation and the problems we are solving for our users.</p>
      <p>I enjoy diving into new technologies, codebases and domains. Running a small company has taught me that being outside your comfort-zone is how you learn and grow.</p>
      <p>I believe that culture trumps strategy, and that a team of people that trust and support each other can conquer any problem.</p>
